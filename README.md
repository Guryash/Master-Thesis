Here, code is added for the supervised learning applied to the clinical dataset, MIMIC - III. Artificial
Neural Network (ANN) or Neural Network, a classification technique, is used to determine the accuracy of
the classifier in recognizing and predicting two diseases, gout and leukemia, with their uric acid measure-
ments. And as second use-case, enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is used to differentiate between
chronic liver and heart failure diseases. The work also investigates the difference between the results of
pre-processed data, using linear regression, and the original data.
